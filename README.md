# Aarogya-Vaahini
Arogya vahini is a website which lets user call to ambulance drivers near our location. This website tracks live location using html 5 package geolocation api at the time of requesting drivers.
This project was made for a hackathon by our team technnomites.
I would like to thank @sks8784 , @richesh27 and @aman-saxena612.
